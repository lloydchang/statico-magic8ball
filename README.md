# A Magic 8 Ball App for watchOS & iOS - Mostly Generated by ChatGPT

I wanted to try learning a new topic and building a relatively simple project using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) as a coding assistant. Before starting this project, I had no prior knowledge of Swift and my last time doing iOS development was 2013. I wanted to see if ChatGPT could teach me to build a simple app for iPhone and Apple Watch and it did.

The final result after a total of ~10 hours of hacking — Yes, the animation is awful, but I think I've done enough for now:

I'm not particularly obsessed with [magic 8-balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball) — it just seemed like an easy thing to make with some fun polishing edge cases. Here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-FYc-eEDa0) if you're wondering what's inside one.

## Summary

While "peer programming" with ChatGPT I found it to be about 75% useful. While not always giving me correct or up-to-date code, it successfully taught me the bits of Swift I needed and gave me solutions to the high-level problems I described. It wrote code for me that eventually worked after some amount of fixing (like casting types) or explanation (like asking it to give me an implementation of a function it referenced. Even when its code wasn't right, it gave me ideas to google for, which was much more time-efficient than digging through docs hoping to stumble across a breakthrough.

Overall, this feels like having a superpower. ChatGTP is like a mostly-knowledgable coworker telling me what to do (although sometimes getting it wrong) and saved me many hours of learning on my own.

## Development Log

Here's an abridged list of the ChatGPT questions I asked in rough chronological order. I also had to ask a lot of clarifying questions or sometimes would ask it things instead of googling. These are the most notable bits.

### Background Knowledge

I started by making sure ChatGTP knew what a magic 8-ball was. No problem there. It all sounds right but I never bothered to check its accuracy with [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball).

### Scaffolding the Watch App

I hadn't used Xcode in years, I had no knowledge of Swift, and I only started wearing an Apple Watch a few months ago. So I needed to start from the beginning.

I asked it to tell me how to build an Apple Watch app that would show one of these random messages. Remember, this stemmed from the conversation about the magic eight ball, so it already had some context:

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 21 25 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227840625-b5e360ce-bf7c-47d5-9e56-122686104265.png)

It gave me Objective-C instructions at first, but then I told it I wanted to use Swift, and we were off. **All of this worked and I had a working watch app that I could tap to display a random message.** This was very promising and I was excited!

I tried ChatGPT with some basic project setup questions and it was helpful:

### Feature: Add a delay before showing the message

At the beginning of the project my knowledge of iOS and Swift was practically non-existant. It took me a lot of time to understand animations, threads, timers, contexts, and Swift closures. I wanted the message to appear after a delay and that took a lot of work to undestand. ChatGPT was helpful with generating code, but not helpful in teaching me about SwiftUI or whatever alien planet iOS/watchOS appears to have turned into.

### Feature: Play a watery gurgling sound

If you're shaking a container with liquid in it, it should sound like that, right? So I grabbed [something that sounded approximately right](https://freesound.org/people/pbimal/sounds/646783/), trimmed and faded it with Audacity, and exported it as.. wait, what formats are supported by Xcode? Let's ask!

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 13 58 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227804255-be4990f6-10f7-495d-a338-81ea927573ac.png)

Coding this was painful. First, ChatGPTs suggestions were out of date, then it was unclear to me where in the lifecycle I should be initializing things and setting up the player and whatever else I'm supposed to do.

### Feature: Let me shake the watch to reveal an answer

Picking a random element from an array and displaying it in a Text view after being tapped was easy. But I wanted to shake my watch like a magic 8 ball and get a new mystical response. The watch has a gyroscope so this should be possible.

ChatGPT nailed this by creating the `motionManager` and checking the `magnitude` of the motion. And it added it by adding it to (what it thought was) my existing code!

Later on for the iOS app, however, ChatGPT was _way_ off:

As far as I know, there's no such thing as `ShakeGesture` and googling didn't turn up anything. Hrmph. I ended up googling [someone else's solution](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-uiviewrepresentable-with-swiftui-7295bfec312b).

### Feature: Animate the eight ball

Hearing the water slooshing sound but not seeing anything move felt a little lifeless. So I wanted the eight ball image to jiggle a little when you asked for a new response.

There was a lot of back and forth here and I started to get a little frustrated. There were probably ~15 back and forths with ChatGPT and three times I said something like "OK, forget all that, let's try again. Here's my code." Finally a breakthrough:

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 08 26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227804713-bcf8af7a-0819-4381-90ec-a8d26c70afd8.png)

### Feature: Add some random variation to the sound

Usually you want to add some variation to a sound if you're hearing it a lot so it doesn't sound robotic. Usually adding a little bit of random pitch offset helps. I asked ChatGPT, but it's responses were way off, and it made me go down a wrong path of trying to use `AVAudioUnitTimePitch`, which isn't available on watchOS. It's explanation of `audioPlayer.rate` is wrong and contradicts the explanation in [the official docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudioplayer/1386118-rate).

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 09 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227804776-68dc8307-aaab-4d9a-ab99-b59be60df593.png)

This was too much work so I added a random rate (actually duration) offset and moved on.

### Bug: Apple Watch coding is difficult

Dealing with activation/deactivation on the watch was annoying. I eventually scrapped the code, added lots of `print()`s, and at this point read [Learn X in Y Minutes (where X=Swift)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/swift/) to try and learn things. ChatGPT gave me lots of ideas, so I spent a lot of time googling again. At least I was given some ideas of what to Google.

### Bug: Timers

ChatGPT successfully taught me about timers in Swift.

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 13 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227804927-0bb3c8c4-6075-41ab-8535-daf4142d9ca6.png)

This was obvious but I wanted to see if ChatGPT knew anything better. Nope!

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 14 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227804978-1dd11d36-f241-495b-b0d2-bfb3e0338a5a.png)

### Let's pretend to get on the app store

I like [this template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1071476530354359587). So let's use Chat GPT to generate the content! And Midjourney for a background image.

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 15 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227805016-3e84b3ef-ad60-4943-97ea-d15f69bbed31.png)

### Conversion to iOS

After lots of tweaking the watch app felt good enough. ChatGPT already had the context, so I just needed to know the differences between it and watchOS. Unfortunately a bunch of this stuff was wrong. XCode mostly bailed me out.

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 17 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227805108-d169db53-6ea6-4bde-98c6-2dd2e54f89c8.png)

But this helped me out, even if the syntax was off.

### Shaking Gesture on iOS

I still don't know how to handle this. ChatGPT wasn't helpful and I still don't know how to do it.

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 14 19 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227805192-470f7519-162d-47ef-8085-9ed559b35a31.png)

Then it made up something called `ShakeGesture`?

### Loading screen tweaks

ChatGPT helped here, but only after two wrong answers.

### Customizing the view

ChatGPT did a great job solving simple problems and modifying parts of my View. It was a lot easier to just ask ChatGPT, which already had my existing View code in context, to do something like change the font settings rather than google it and/or dig through code completion or docs. This was one of my favorite parts of using it because I felt like it was talking to an expert — or at least someone who had read a million tutorials and documentation pages ;)

![CleanShot 2023-03-26 at 20 35 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137158/227834640-d1062e05-c77d-43e9-84f6-6a11812520de.png)

### Figuring out 3D models

One place ChatGPT did not help is when I couldn't figure out how to work with the COLLADA model of the eight ball I had downloaded. Between my main View and another component which later became BallView, it really wasn't clear to me where to instantiate things. Pasting my code or error messages and saying "What's wrong" usually didn't help. It took a lot of debugging and reasoning and context to get the 3D model working.

### Animating the ball

What I _wanted_ but didn't get (as you can see from the video) is some kind of shake or rotation animation that didn't stink. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get a working example. ChatGPT got me really *close* however, and I think with enough time of diving into SceneKit I could probably figure the rest out. But there was a long time where ChatGPT gave me different kinds of solutions after subsequent questions, and many of them needed clarification or implementations of functions it made up (not that they were hard, like matrix multiplication). I feel like I spent a lot of time here and ChatGPT gave me a lot of solutions it thought would help. I learned a lot but didn't achieve my goal.

Some examples:

### Final bits: Midjourney

I tried to come up with some interesting images in Midjourney. I really wanted some kind of interesting background for the app, some kind of weird mystical background with eight balls for the hypothetical app store listing, and I really wanted just a royalty-free magic eight ball image with the blue upside-down triangle for the watch app which can't use a 3D model.

Alas, I simply couldn't get a good magic eight ball image generated, or at least one with the triangle the way I wanted (like ▼ not ▲). So I took the best one it made, removed the background with [removal.ai](https://removal.ai/upload/), and trimmed transparent pixels with [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) because I still don't have the ImageMagick command memorized that does that.

Here are some interesting bits in that process:
