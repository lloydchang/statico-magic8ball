# Magic 8 Ball for watchOS & iOS, Mostly Generated by ChatGPT and Midjourney

(Yes, the animation is awful, but I ran out of time this weekend.)

## Why?

I wanted to try learning a new topic and building a relatively simple project using ChatGPT. I had no prior knowledge of Swift and last did iOS development in 2013. I've done a little 3D before.

## TL;DR

ChatGPT had about a 75% usefuless rating. It successfully taught me the bits of Swift I needed, gave me solutions to the high-level problems I described, and wrote code for me that usually worked after some amount of fixing (e.g. casting types) or explanation (asking it to give me an implementation of a function it referenced. Notably it had a lot of trouble with the deprecated classes with watchOS/iOS. However, overall this feels like superpowers -- ChatGTP was like a mostly-knowledgable coworker telling me what to do (though sometimes getting it wrong and we needed to google it) and saved me many hours of learning.

I couldn't find a usable, free magic 8-ball 3D model, so I used a nice regular 8-ball model.
